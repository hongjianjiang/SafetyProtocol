Protocol: result

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 90456 bits (rounded up to 11312 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  8 Mbytes.
	  With states hash-compressed to 40 bits, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 1379321 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 137932 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Result:

	Deadlocked state found.

State Space Explored:

	30 states, 31 rules fired in 0.11s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
